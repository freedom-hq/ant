//! On-chain recovery of node-owned state from the node EOA (PLAN.md
//! "node-owned on-chain state recovery").
//!
//! Two discoveries, both driven purely by the node's public Ethereum
//! address (the `swarm.key` EOA) over JSON-RPC, so a node started on a
//! data dir carried over from bee — same key, no sidecar registry —
//! comes back up with its existing on-chain state intact:
//!
//! 1. [`owned_batches_in`] — the postage batches this EOA owns
//!    and that are still funded, so they can be re-registered as usable
//!    stamp issuers.
//! 2. [`owned_chequebook_in`] — the SWAP chequebook this EOA
//!    deployed, so the node adopts it instead of deploying a fresh one
//!    (stranding the old balance).
//!
//! Both read a single cheap scan, [`refresh_transfer_scan`]: the ERC-20
//! `Transfer` event on the xBZZ token, filtered by the indexed `from`
//! topic = node EOA. That filter returns only the node's own outgoing
//! transfers (a tiny set), and every funded chequebook / bought batch
//! was paid for by an ERC-20 transfer *from* the node EOA, so the target
//! addresses are all in the `to` field of that set. The scan is saved in
//! the data dir and continued on the next start, so only the first start
//! reads the history from the xBZZ deploy block.
