//! Pluggable JSON-RPC transport for the chain module (issue #77).
//!
//! Every chain request this crate issues goes through
//! [`ChainClient::rpc`](crate::ChainClient::rpc). By default that is the
//! configured Gnosis RPC URL — exactly what ant has always done. A host
//! that has its own *verified* chain source (Freedom's embedded Myotis
//! light client, a Colibri stateless verifier, an RPC quorum, …) can
//! install a [`ChainTransport`] and get first refusal on each request.
//!
//! The seam is deliberately **transport, not policy**: ant keeps issuing
//! precisely the requests it issued before (`eth_call`, `eth_getBalance`,
//! `eth_getLogs`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, `eth_sendRawTransaction`,
//! `eth_getTransactionCount`, `eth_blockNumber`, `eth_getCode`), and the
//! transport only decides *where* they are answered.
//!
//! # Can't-serve
//!
//! A host is allowed to answer "not me" for any request, and ant then
//! falls through to the configured URL exactly as if no transport were
//! installed. Two answers mean can't-serve:
//!
//! 1. **`None`** (a `NULL` return across the FFI) — the host does not
//!    serve this request at all.
//! 2. **A retryable `-32000`** ([`RETRYABLE_ERROR_CODE`]) — the host
//!    *would* serve it but its backing index does not cover the
//!    requested range yet, and the error carries the window it does
//!    cover (Myotis' log-index coverage semantics). This must fall
//!    through: surfacing it as an error (or worse, as an empty result)
//!    would silently truncate batch discovery.
//!
//! Any other JSON-RPC `error` member is a genuine answer (an `eth_call`
//! revert, say) and is surfaced to the caller unchanged.
//!
//! # `-32000` is for coverage gaps only
//!
//! **A host must emit `-32000` only when its index cannot cover the
//! request** — never as a generic failure code. geth and Nethermind use
//! `-32000` as a catch-all for genuine, non-retryable failures as well:
//! `nonce too low`, `already known`, `insufficient funds for gas * price
//! + value`, `replacement transaction underpriced`, and on some backends
//! `execution reverted`. A host whose verified ladder bottoms out at an
//! RPC-quorum stage and forwards backend replies verbatim therefore
//! turns every one of those into can't-serve, and ant replays the
//! request against the configured URL: for `eth_sendRawTransaction` that
//! is a *second broadcast* of an already-signed transaction, and the
//! caller then sees the fallback URL's error instead of the real one.
//! Map any failure that is not a coverage gap to a different error code,
//! or answer authoritatively.

/// JSON-RPC error code that means "retryable — I can't cover this

/// covered block window in the error's `data`; ant does not parse that
/// window (it has no use for it — it simply falls back), it only needs
/// to know the answer is *not* an authoritative empty result.
///
/// Reserved for that one meaning: a host that also emits `-32000` for
/// genuine failures (as geth and Nethermind do for `nonce too low`,
/// `already known`, `insufficient funds …`, `replacement transaction
/// underpriced`, `execution reverted`) makes ant replay those requests

/// thread (ant runs it on the runtime's blocking pool), so an
/// implementation may do synchronous I/O, take locks, or block on its
/// own executor without starving the node's async tasks.
///
/// Return the JSON-RPC response body for `request_json`, or `None` to
/// signal can't-serve — see the [module docs](self). Implementations
/// must not panic; a panic is caught and treated as can't-serve, but it
/// costs a fallback round trip.
///
/// An implementation that wraps other backends must not pass their
/// `-32000` errors through: here that code means "coverage gap, try
/// elsewhere" and nothing else, while geth/Nethermind also use it for
/// genuine failures (`nonce too low`, `already known`, `insufficient
/// funds …`, `execution reverted`). Forwarding those verbatim gets the
/// request replayed against the configured URL — a second broadcast for
