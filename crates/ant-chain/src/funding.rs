//! Storage funding shared by `antd` and `ant-ffi`: price a postage plan
//! against the node wallet, and pay for it (or for extending or resizing
//! it, or for the chequebook's settlement deposit) with **xDAI only**.
//!
//! The node wallet is the only account involved. The user sends it plain
//! xDAI; the node swaps whatever xBZZ it lacks through the stateless
//! `BzzSwapHelper` ([`crate::tx::swap_helper_address`]), then approves
//! and buys. Every quote is computed from the wallet's balances at that
//! moment, so a retry after a partial failure (the swap landed,
//! `createBatch` didn't) only asks for, and only swaps, what is still
//! missing.
//!
//! One orchestration, two sequencers (AGENTS.md): `ant-ffi`'s C API
//! (`ant_storage_quote`, `ant_storage_buy_xdai`, …) and the gateway's
//! `/v0/storage/*` routes (served by `antd` and by `ant-ffi`'s
//! `ant_start_gateway`) both call the `pub` helpers here. The
//! `parity_guard` test in `ant-ffi` checks that.
