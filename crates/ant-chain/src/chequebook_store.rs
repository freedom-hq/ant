//! Shared chequebook bootstrap: the on-disk association record plus the
//! "resolve / deploy a node-owned chequebook" mechanics that both
//! `antd` (at startup) and `ant-ffi` (on the first storage buy) need
//! for outbound SWAP settlement.
//!
//! The cheque *protocol* lives in [`crate::chequebook`] (EIP-712
//! signing, calldata) and the *wire* lives in `ant-p2p`. This module is
//! the thin orchestration layer in between: where a chequebook comes
//! from and how its address is persisted across restarts, so a node
//! deploys once and reuses forever. Building the actual
//! `ant_p2p::PushsyncSwapConfig` from the resolved address stays with
//! each caller, since that type belongs to a higher layer.
//!
//! `load_persisted_chequebook_for` / `persist_chequebook` / [`ChequebookFile`]
//! are pure file I/O and compile everywhere; the deploy / factory-check
//! helpers drive a JSON-RPC node and are gated on `chain-rpc`.

/// that has left. The same holds when the call never sees the receipt
/// (a timeout, an RPC error, a cancelled future), since the transaction
/// may still land; only a revert, or a transaction never signed,
/// releases it.
