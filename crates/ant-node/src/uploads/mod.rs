//! `antctl upload` job manager.
//!
//! Responsible for the long-lived state of in-flight, paused,
//! completed, and cancelled uploads. Each job is one daemon-side
//! task that walks a source file, splits it incrementally with
//! [`StreamingSplitter`], and pushsyncs every produced chunk to the
//! network through the existing [`ControlCommand::PushChunk`]
//! pipeline (so postage stamping reuses
//! `ant_p2p::UploadRuntime::issuer` exactly the way `POST /chunks`
//! does today).
//!
//! ## Key design points
//!
//! - **Streaming.** The source is mmap'd via [`memmap2::Mmap`] so a
//!   7 GiB file doesn't double-allocate; the kernel pages it in/out
//!   as we walk it. Resident memory is `levels × BRANCHES × 32 B +
//!   in-flight push window` ≈ tens of KB for any file size.
//!
//! - **Resume.** [`StreamingSplitter`] is deterministic (same input
//!   ⇒ same chunk addresses), so on resume we re-mmap, re-stream
//!   from byte 0, recompute every address, and skip pushsync for
//!   the first `chunks_pushed` chunks. No per-chunk receipts on
//!   disk, no double-stamping (the postage issuer is only consulted
//!   when we actually dispatch a `PushChunk`).
//!
//! - **Pause / cancel.** A driver checks
//!   [`JobHandle::pause_requested`] / [`JobHandle::cancel_requested`]
//!   between every chunk dispatch and every chunk completion. On
//!   pause it drains in-flight pushes, checkpoints state, and parks
//!   on a [`Notify`]. Cancel returns immediately and lets the
//!   future call drop in-flight work.
//!
//! - **Persistence.** [`UploadJobInfo`] is rewritten atomically
//!   (tmp → fsync → rename) every `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_CHUNKS`
//!   pushes plus on every state transition. A daemon crash mid-push
//!   loses at most this many chunks of progress (we just re-push
//!   them on the next start; pushsync is idempotent at the
//!   network level, so duplicate pushes for already-replicated
//!   chunks are a wasted RTT but not a correctness bug).
//!
//! - **Concurrency.** Bounded at [`MAX_PUSH_CONCURRENCY`] in-flight
//!   pushes per job (matches the gateway's parallel push width).
//!   Multiple jobs share the daemon's process-wide retrieval /
//!   pushsync semaphores, so two simultaneous uploads don't double
//!   the load on neighbours.
//!
//! - **Retries never hold a slot.** A transiently-failed chunk parks
//!   in a [`RetryQueue`] for its (jittered) back-off and is
//!   re-dispatched when due, so every in-flight slot is always doing
//!   network work (bee's pusher shape). Once the splitter is drained
//!   and only a few stragglers remain, re-dispatches are hedged
//!   across [`TAIL_HEDGE_WIDTH`] concurrent pushsync commands and the
//!   first receipt wins — pushsync is idempotent, so the losers cost
//!   wasted RTTs, not correctness.
