//! Routing-aware [`ChunkFetcher`] for production use.
//!
//! Wraps a `libp2p_stream::Control` and a static snapshot of
//! `(PeerId, overlay)` peers — the closest BZZ peers we have to *any*
//! target — and exposes a fetch method that:
//!
//! 1. picks the peer whose overlay XORs with the requested chunk address
//!    to the smallest big-endian value (forwarding-Kademlia "closest");
//! 2. opens a `/swarm/retrieval/1.4.0/retrieval` stream, runs the bee
//!    headers handshake, sends a [`crate::PROTOCOL_RETRIEVAL`] request,
//!    and reads the delivery;
//! 3. on failure, falls back to the next-closest peer up to a small
//!    bounded retry count, so a single bad peer doesn't tank a whole
//!    file fetch.
//!
//! The snapshot is taken at command time by the node loop; new BZZ
//! handshakes during the fetch don't show up here, but no in-flight
//! manifest walk is so long-lived that it matters in practice. Re-issuing
//! the command is cheap.

/// banning the peer for the rest of the request is wasteful.
/// `Timeout` likewise often reflects a deep forwarding hop that
/// stalled, not the local peer being broken.
///
/// `Io(_)` is *also* non-fatal, and this is the load-bearing addition
/// that fixed the "WAV files won't load" production regression: bee
/// signals "I don't have this chunk" by closing the `libp2p_stream`
/// without writing the protobuf reply. Our reader then surfaces
/// `UnexpectedEof` (most common) or `BrokenPipe` / `ConnectionReset`
/// (when the close races our read), all of which surface here as
/// `Io(_)`. Treating those as peer-fatal blacklisted ~3 peers per
/// chunk on a multi-MiB media file: we observed 292 distinct peers
/// blacklisted in a single 90-second `/bytes/` fetch (against a
/// connected peer set of ~100), at which point sibling chunks had
/// no candidates left and the joiner deadlocked into the request
/// timeout. If a peer's libp2p *connection* (not just one stream)
/// genuinely dies, libp2p emits a `peer disconnected` event and the
/// `peers_watch` removes them from the candidate pool — that's the
/// proper signal, not an Io error from a single stream.
///
/// `OpenStream(_)` is likewise kept per-chunk. Treating it as fatal was
/// faster for isolated single-file fetches, but live gateway verification
/// with four parallel WAVs showed the shared request blacklist poisoning
/// otherwise healthy file attempts: enough sibling chunks raced through
/// stale address-book entries that later chunks exhausted their candidate
/// set and returned `all peers failed`. The `peers_watch` remains the
/// source of truth for peer liveness; one stream-open failure is not
/// enough to ban a peer for every other chunk in the file.
///
/// We still blacklist on framing errors (`MessageTooLarge`,
