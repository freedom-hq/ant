//! Swarm retrieval protocol client.
//!
//! Implements the **dialer** side of `bee` `pkg/retrieval`
//! (`/swarm/retrieval/1.4.0/retrieval`): given a chunk address and a peer
//! we have a live BZZ connection to, open a libp2p stream, exchange the
//! mandatory bee-headers preamble, send a `retrieval.Request{Addr}`, read
//! a `retrieval.Delivery{Data, Err}`, and verify the returned bytes are
//! a valid content-addressed chunk (CAC) for the requested address.
//!
//! # Wire shape
//!
//! Every bee protocol stream (except `/swarm/handshake/14.0.0/handshake`)
//! is wrapped with two varint-length-delimited `headers.Headers` messages
//! exchanged before the protocol body — this is what `bee`
//! `pkg/p2p/libp2p/headers.go` does in `sendHeaders` (dialer) and
//! `handleHeaders` (listener). The dialer writes first, then reads:
//!
//! ```text
//! us → bee : varint(0) || empty pb.Headers     // sendHeaders write
//! bee → us : varint(0) || empty pb.Headers     // sendHeaders read
//! us → bee : varint(N) || retrieval.Request    // protocol body out
//! bee → us : varint(M) || retrieval.Delivery   // protocol body in
//! us → bee : (close write half)                // bee FullClose expects EOF
//! ```
//!
//! Bee passes `nil` for retrieval headers, so an empty `pb.Headers`
//! encodes to zero bytes and the wire varint length is `0x00`. We send the
//! same and accept any size from bee (it might add tracing headers in
//! future). Going the other way: dropping our write side before bee's
//! `sendHeaders` read returns triggers `Disconnect(peer, "could not fully
//! close stream on retrieval")` ~80 ms later — same gotcha we already
//! handle on the BZZ handshake.
//!
//! # Why not push payment?
//!
//! Bee's retrieval handler calls `accounting.PrepareDebit(peer, price)`
//! before writing the delivery and applies it after a successful write.
//! For *small* origin requests under the per-peer `paymentThreshold`
//! (currently 100M PLUR per chunk price; payment threshold is 100GB BZZ
//! by default) bee just builds up debt against us and never demands a
//! cheque, so a one-off chunk fetch works without SWAP wired up. A
//! sustained reader would need to honor SWAP debits (M3 territory); we
//! deliberately don't here.
