//! Neighbourhoods where a push could not reach a deep storer.
//!
//! A light node hunts hard for a deep receipt
//! ([`crate::RoutingFetcher::MAX_SHALLOW_ATTEMPTS`] attempts, each after a
//! neighbourhood dial and a bounded wait): a chunk stored outside its
//! neighbourhood is not retrievable by the routed network. But when a
//! neighbourhood has no storer this node can get a deep receipt from (it
//! is empty, or its one node is unreachable), every chunk that falls in
//! it repeats the whole ~30 s hunt and still lands shallow. Measured on
//! mainnet (2026-10-12): after the network's storage radius rose from 8
//! to 9, one depth-9 neighbourhood with a single node caught a chunk of
//! nearly every 2 s video segment, so every segment took ~30 s to
//! publish and 540p/720p broadcasts fell minutes behind.
//!
//! So a hunt that ends shallow marks the chunk's neighbourhood (its
//! address prefix at the storer's reported radius) for [`TTL`]: until
//! then, best-effort pushes of chunks in it accept their first shallow
//! receipt (the chunk *is* stored) instead of hunting again. When the
//! mark expires the next chunk hunts in full, so a neighbourhood that
//! became reachable is noticed. Strict pushes (`with_require_deep`)
//! never consult it.
