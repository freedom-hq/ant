//! Swarm feed dereferencing.
//!
//! Bee implements *mutable* references on top of immutable content-addressed
//! storage by signing successive "update" chunks under a stable identity
//! (owner + topic). Anyone who knows the owner address and topic — or, more
//! commonly, the **feed manifest** that packages them — can look up the
//! latest update and follow its payload to the current content root.
//!
//! This module mirrors `bee/pkg/feeds`, `bee/pkg/feeds/sequence`, and
//! `bee/pkg/soc`. Only the `Sequence` feed type is implemented (which is
//! also the only type Bee currently writes through `/feeds/{owner}/{topic}`).
//! Within the legacy v1 payload layout (`span ‖ ts ‖ ref`) the wrapped
//! reference is read directly out of the SOC's CAC; v2 (where the SOC's
//! CAC is itself a reference to a separately-stored chunk) is detected and
//! transparently followed by re-fetching that wrapped chunk.
//!
//! # Wire shapes
//!
//! ## Feed manifest (mantaray)
//!
//! A feed manifest is a normal mantaray manifest with a single fork at
//! `/` whose value entry is `swarm.ZeroAddress` and whose metadata
//! carries:
//!
//! ```text
//! swarm-feed-owner = <40 hex>     // 20-byte ETH address, hex-encoded
//! swarm-feed-topic = <64 hex>     // 32-byte topic, hex-encoded
//! swarm-feed-type  = "Sequence"   // only "Sequence" is supported here
//! ```
//!
//! See `bee/pkg/api/feed.go::feedPostHandler`.
//!
//! ## Feed update address (sequence type)
//!
//! ```text
//! id   = keccak256(topic ‖ index_be8)
//! addr = keccak256(id ‖ owner_eth)
//! ```
//!
//! `index_be8` is `u64::to_be_bytes()` of the sequence index (0, 1, 2, …).
//! See `bee/pkg/feeds/feed.go::id::MarshalBinary` and `soc.CreateAddress`.
//!
//! ## SOC chunk layout
//!
//! ```text
//! chunkData = id(32) ‖ signature(65) ‖ cac_data(span(8) ‖ payload(N))
//! ```
//!
//! The signature is over `keccak256(id ‖ cac_address)` (raw, no EIP-191
//! prefix). The signer's recovered Ethereum address must equal
//! `owner_eth` to pass verification. See `bee/pkg/soc/soc.go::FromChunk`.
//!
//! ## Wrapped CAC payload (v1 vs v2)
//!
//! - **v1 (legacy)**: the wrapped CAC's data is `span(8) ‖ ts(8) ‖
//!   ref(32 or 64)`, i.e. total length 48 (unencrypted ref) or 80
//!   (encrypted ref). The reference the feed points at is the bytes
//!   after the timestamp (`cac_data[16..]`).
//! - **v2**: the wrapped CAC *is itself* the content root chunk; the
//!   reference the feed points at is simply the wrapped CAC's own
//!   address. No `ts ‖ ref` indirection.
//!
//! A wrapped CAC of length 48 or 80 is **ambiguous** — it could be a v1
//! payload or a v2 content chunk that happens to be that size. Bee's
//! `resolveFeed` (`bee/pkg/api/bzz.go`) races both interpretations and
//! requires the winning one's wrapped address to actually be
//! retrievable from the chunk store; when neither resolves it fails
//! with `feeds.WrappedChunkNotFoundError`, which the HTTP layer
//! surfaces as `404 "wrapped chunk cannot be retrieved"`. We mirror
//! that deterministically: for an ambiguous length we probe the v1
//! reference, classify as v1 if it resolves, and otherwise fail with
//! [`FeedError::WrappedChunkNotFound`]. We do **not** fall back to
//! serving the wrapped CAC itself as v2 — ant caches every SOC's
//! wrapped CAC locally on `PushSoc` (for v2 read-after-own-write), so
//! probing the wrapped CAC's own address is degenerate here and would
//! serve a dead v1 update's raw `ts ‖ ref` payload as content where
//! bee 404s. Any other length is unambiguously v2 and served without
//! a probe, matching bee's single-branch v2 resolution.

/// headers.
///
/// # Why this isn't a linear stop-at-first-miss scan
///
/// A naive `0, 1, 2, …` walk that stops at the first missing index is
/// only correct on a perfectly-retrievable feed. On the live network a
/// fetch for a present update chunk can fail transiently (the closest
/// peer to that SOC address times out, drops the stream, or is briefly
/// unreachable). A linear scan that treats the first such miss as the end
/// of the feed then either returns a **stale** earlier update (silent
/// wrong answer) or — when the terminating probe's error isn't
/// "not found"-shaped — fails the whole lookup. Both are intermittent and
/// scale with the number of updates, which is exactly the
/// "feeds sometimes don't work" symptom. Bee never hits this because its
/// `sequence.asyncFinder` probes ahead and *retries inconsistent
/// intervals*, so a transient miss at a present index is recovered.
///
/// This finder reproduces bee's resilience (and its `O(log n)` probe
/// count) without the channel-based concurrency:
///
/// 1. **Anchor.** Index 0 must resolve. Absent ⇒ [`FeedError::NoUpdates`];
///    a persistent transient ⇒ [`FeedError::Fetch`] so the caller retries.
/// 2. **Bracket (exponential).** Double the offset from the last known
///    present index until a probe is absent, yielding a present `lo` and
///    an absent `hi`.
/// 3. **Boundary (binary search).** Bisect `(lo, hi)` for the
///    present→absent edge.
/// 4. **Confirm (lookahead).** Probe `lo + 2^k` for `k in 0..=`
///    [`LOOKAHEAD_LEVELS`]. If any is present, a transient miss hid a
///    later update — adopt it and repeat from step 2. Only when the whole
///    window is absent is `lo` accepted as the latest, mirroring bee's
///    "inconsistent feed, retry".
///
/// For a well-formed, fully-retrievable feed this returns the identical
/// update bee's finder would, and a sequence feed's contiguous indexing
/// guarantees termination (a peer cannot forge a valid owner-signed SOC
