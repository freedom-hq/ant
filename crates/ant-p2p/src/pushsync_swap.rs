//! Outbound SWAP settlement: the node's cheque payer.
//!
//! # What this does
//!
//! [`PushsyncSwap`] pays peers with EIP-712 `/swarm/swap/1.0.0/swap`
//! cheques drawn on the node's chequebook, the way bee's
//! `swapprotocol.EmitCheque` does: it reads the recipient's `exchange` /
//! `deduction` response headers, refuses rates above bee's price oracle,
//! pays `units × exchange + deduction` PLUR and never issues past
//! `deposit − total issued` (bee's `AvailableBalance`). It is the
//! [`RetrievalPayment`] of the shared `ant_retrieval::accounting`
//! mirror, which holds one balance per peer for downloads *and* uploads
//! (as bee's accounting does) and decides when to pay; see
//! [`PushsyncSwap`].
//!
//! # History
//!
//! Until issue #127 the pushsync side kept its own debt counter here and
//! emitted cheques for `debt` *PLUR* whenever it crossed 675 K, ignoring
//! the exchange rate: bee credited about 1/100 000 of the debt, so
//! uploads really settled by the free refresh alone. Pushsync debt now
//! goes into the shared mirror (`push_pseudosettle::PushPseudosettle`)
//! and is paid by the same payer, priced like bee, under the same
//! `swap-enable` switch.
//!
//! # Glossary
//!
//! - **Beneficiary**: 20-byte EOA recovered from the peer's BZZ
//!   handshake signature (`HandshakeInfo::remote_eth_address`). It's
//!   the address bee credits when it cashes our cheque.
//! - **Cumulative payout**: the running total of PLUR our chequebook
//!   has authorised paying to this beneficiary across our entire
//!   relationship. EIP-712 cheques are cumulative — cheque N+1 has
//!   `cumulative = cheque N's cumulative + delta`. Bee accepts the
//!   highest cumulative it sees and ignores duplicates / older ones.
//!
//! # Wiring
//!
//! `antd` and `ant-ffi` build one [`PushsyncSwap`] per chequebook
//! (`--chequebook` / `--swap-key`, or the FFI's settlement setup). The
//! swarm loop populates [`PeerEthMap`] in the BZZ-handshake-success
//! branch and installs the service as the accounting payer while the
//! node's `swap-enable` switch is on and the chequebook has funds.
