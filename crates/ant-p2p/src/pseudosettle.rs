//! Outbound bee `/swarm/pseudosettle/1.0.0/pseudosettle` driver.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Bee tracks per-peer **debt** for every chunk it serves us. The disconnect
//! threshold for a light-mode peer (we declare `full_node: false` in the
//! handshake) is `lightDisconnectLimit ≈ 1.69M units` on a default-config
//! mainnet node. At a typical chunk price of `~150_000 units`, that's about
//! **11 chunks per peer before bee rejects further requests with
//! `ErrDisconnectThresholdExceeded`** and blocklists our overlay locally.
//!
//! For a one-shot small file the burst stays under the limit, but a streaming
//! `/bzz` of a 50 MiB media file fans out to ~15k chunk fetches — many of
//! them concentrated on the few peers closest to the file's neighbourhood.
//! Without a way to reset that debt, those hot peers reject us long before
//! the download finishes; without `pseudosettle` the only recovery is to
//! redial fresh peers, which is the peer-set thrash we observed during the
//! 0.3.0 streaming regression.
//!
//! # The protocol (bee 2.7.x and 2.8.0)
//!
//! Pseudosettle is unchanged between bee 2.6 → 2.7.x → 2.8.0. The 2.8
//! release reshapes the BZZ handshake (handshake `15.0.0`, new signed
//! preimage) but leaves the per-peer `PaymentSent` / `PaymentReceived`
//! flow we depend on here alone.
//!
//! `pseudosettle` is bee's free **time-based debt refresh** mechanism. The
//! exchange is symmetric (either peer can dial), single round-trip, no
//! negotiation:
//!
//! ```text
//! dialer → listener : varint + Headers pb (empty)        // bee headers preamble
//! listener → dialer : varint + Headers pb (empty)
//! dialer → listener : varint + Payment{ amount: bytes }  // big-endian big.Int
//! listener → dialer : varint + PaymentAck{ amount, timestamp }
//! ```
//!
//! The listener (bee, here) clamps `amount` to
//! `min(attempted, lightRefreshRate * (now - lastTimestamp), our_debt)` and
//! returns the accepted figure plus its current Unix timestamp in seconds.
//! That's all that's needed to clear our debt up to the refresh-rate budget
//! since the previous successful settle.
//!
//! See `bee/pkg/settlement/pseudosettle/pseudosettle.go::Pay` for the bee
//! dialer reference and `::handler` for the listener.
//!
//! # What this module does
//!
//! Three pieces:
//!
//! 1. **Inbound drain** ([`run_inbound`]). Bee's `pseudosettle.Protocol`
//!    declares a `ConnectIn`/`ConnectOut` callback that runs `init`, which in
//!    turn registers us in their per-peer `s.peers` map *before any
//!    pseudosettle stream is opened*. So bee never actually dials us for
//!    pseudosettle in normal operation (we're the consumer, not the
//!    forwarder). On the off chance that some peer does, we drain and
//!    NAK-with-zero so they don't get billed for nothing. This is purely
//!    defensive; the steady-state rate of inbound pseudosettle is ~zero.
//!
//! 2. **Outbound refresh** ([`refresh_peer`]). Opens the pseudosettle
//!    stream, exchanges headers, sends a `Payment` with our intended
//!    refresh amount, reads the `PaymentAck`. Returns the accepted amount
//!    and the bee-side timestamp, or an error on stream / framing failure.
//!
//! 3. **Driver task** ([`run_driver`]). A background tokio task that
//!    follows bee's dialer rules (`Accounting.settle`, `pseudosettle.Pay`):
//!    it refreshes a peer only when the accounting mirror says we owe it
//!    enough to be worth it ([`Accounting::refresh_due`]), one refresh per
//!    peer at a time, [`MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL`] after the previous one
//!    completed, bounded by [`MAX_INFLIGHT_REFRESHES`] with no queue behind
//!    the bound, and backs off after a failure. See [`run_driver`] for why
//!    each rule matters (issue #129).

/// [`refresh_peer`] for each peer a refresh is due to.
///
/// The rules are bee's dialer side (`Accounting.settle`,
/// `pseudosettle.Pay`):
///
/// - **Only when owed.** With the accounting mirror attached, a refresh
///   is due only once the mirror's debt to the peer reaches bee's settle
///   trigger ([`Accounting::refresh_due`]). Bee answers a refresh with
///   `min(asked, elapsed × lightRefreshRate, our debt)` and restarts the
///   peer's allowance clock even when that is zero, so refreshing a peer
///   we owe nothing wastes a stream and the allowance it had built up.
/// - **One at a time, a second apart.** At most one refresh per peer is
///   in flight, and the next starts [`MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL`] after the
///   previous one completed. Bee refuses a second refresh within the
///   same Unix second (`ErrSettlementTooSoon`) by resetting the stream.
/// - **No backlog.** A refresh starts only with a free in-flight permit
///   ([`MAX_INFLIGHT_REFRESHES`]); the most indebted due peers go first,
///   the rest wait for the next tick instead of queueing.
/// - **Back off after a failure** ([`FAILED_REFRESH_BACKOFF`], doubling),
///   so a connection bee no longer serves isn't hit every second.
///
/// `peers_rx` carries the routing-table snapshot — the peers we've
/// completed the BZZ handshake with and can actually open substreams
/// to. The driver consults it every tick and skips refreshes for
/// peers that are no longer in the snapshot, so long-lived gateway
/// load (where the routing set churns through thousands of peers per
/// hour) doesn't spend refreshes on `no addresses for peer` errors.
