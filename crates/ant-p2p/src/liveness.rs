//! Connection liveness (issue #83): notice dead peer sockets on our own,
//! without waiting for the host to call `ant_resume`.
//!
//! A connection whose socket was reaped while the app was frozen, or whose
//! NAT mapping expired, is *half-open*: our side never sees a FIN, so libp2p
//! keeps it, the peer counter keeps counting it and retrievals keep being
//! routed into it. rust-libp2p's ping behaviour notices the missing pongs
//! but, since libp2p-ping 0.43, only reports them; closing the connection is
//! up to us. Before this module nothing did, so such a connection lived until
//! the kernel gave up retransmitting (~15 min on Linux).
//!
//! The rules, all driven by successful outbound pings:
//!
//! * a connection is **live** while its last pong is younger than
//!   [`LivenessConfig::live_window`]; [`Liveness::stale_peers`] lists the
//!   peers none of whose connections is live, and the status snapshot's
//!   `peers.connected` (`ant_peer_count`) doesn't count them;
//! * a connection that stays silent [`LivenessConfig::close_grace`] past
//!   that is **dead**: the swarm loop closes it
//!   ([`Liveness::dead_connections`]), which drops the peer from routing and
//!   lets the top-up guards redial;
//! * the ping handler's own failure report (two consecutive failed pings)
//!   closes the connection at once.
//!
//! A close on a dead link finishes within `bounded_close::CLOSE_TIMEOUT`
//! even when unsent data fills the socket's send buffer (the muxer's
//! graceful flush is abandoned then), so `ConnectionClosed` and its peer
//! teardown follow the close by at most that long. A connection being
//! closed counts as stale and is closed only once.
//!
//! **Freezes.** After the process was frozen (iOS / Android background
//! suspension), every pong is old, live sockets included: the pings that
//! would have refreshed them never ran. [`Liveness::tick`] notices the swarm
//! loop's own stall and gives every connection
//! [`LivenessConfig::resume_verify`] from the moment the loop runs again to
//! answer a ping before it counts as stale, rather than closing the live
//! connections along with the dead ones. A suspension that also stops the
//! monotonic clock (Linux/Android system suspend) leaves no visible gap, but
//! then the pongs don't look old either: the regular rules apply in awake
//! time and close the dead sockets within one `live_window + close_grace`.
//!
//! **Our own link (issue #90).** The same pongs tell whether *our* network
//! works at all: [`Liveness::network_unproven`] is true while no connection
//! has answered within [`LivenessConfig::proof_window`], or none has since
//! the network was last suspected to have changed under us (a loop stall,
//! or a `Resume` / self-heal, see [`Liveness::suspect_network`]). The swarm
//! loop doesn't charge outbound dial failures to the remote peer then:
//! with zombie sockets still in `bzz_peers` after a suspend or a handover,
//! a non-empty peer set says nothing about whether the link works.
